            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                HOPE ACADEMY NURSERY AND PRIMARY SCHOOL, OJUWOCHA was established in the year 2014 with a vision to bring quality, affordable education to the children of Ojuwocha and its surrounding communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                What began as a humble initiative with a small group of passionate educators and a handful of pupils has grown into a thriving institution known for academic excellence and holistic child development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, the school has expanded its infrastructure, introduced modern teaching aids, and continually trained staff to uphold the highest educational standards. Today, HOPE ACADEMY remains committed to its founding missionâ€”empowering children with knowledge, skills, and values that last a lifetime.
